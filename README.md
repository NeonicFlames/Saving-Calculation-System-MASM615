# Saving-Calculation-System-MASM615



This is one of the question of my final semester project.
This program is using Irvine64 as the library and MASM615.

The purpose of this program is to

1. Calculate Savings of each month.
2. Calculate every 1 month of Savings. ( By subtracting Income and Expense ) e.g 20000 - 7700
3. Displaying the *total* of savings
